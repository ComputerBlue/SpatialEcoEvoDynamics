posterior means, standard deviations and the different posterior quantiles of the fitted model



################
Metapopdata2Anna.csv
Data used to fit the model. Data from on Jousimo science papers supplementary material.
Variables:
"ID" 		=patch id                   
"Year"  	=year                
"Longitude"     =coordinate        
"Latitude"              
"PA"            = Pathogen presence in the patch (current year)
"PAPrev"            = Pathogen presence in the patch (previous year)      
"road_PA"          = If the patch has road intersecting with it      
"Distance_to_shore"  = Distance to nearest shore (hopefully in meters?)       
"Habitat.boundary_open" = Science paper has the definition?
"Plant.dryness"   = The surveyed measure for plant dryness   
"Patch.shadow"   = Science paper has the definition, perhaps related to habitat boundary?      
"Rainfall_August"  = The monthly rainfall computed from the satellite data        
"Rainfall_July"  = The monthly rainfall computed from the satellite data        
"Sh"          = The host connectivity measure from the science paper.            
"PatchArea"  = total area of the patch (the area of the polygon defining the patch boundaries)           
"Hostm2"     = Host coverage in the patch at the current year           
"Hostm2Prev"  = Host coverage in the patch at the previous year          
"ShCat"       = Host connectivity categories based on the 0.2 and 0.8 quantiles           
"PropDryPrev"   = Proportion of dry host plants previous year       
"PropDry"          = Proportion of dry host plants this year     
"PathPresence"      = Pathogen was at the population either this year of the previous year




################
PhenotypeCodes.csv
Phenotype = the id of the phenotype (with this key you can link the phenotype to the PhenotypeDiversity.csv
Description = string describing the resistance profile. '0000' means susceptible to all 4 pathogen strains, '0010' means resistant only towards a3 pathogen. 
a1 = susceptible/resistant to the pathogen strain 1 (0 = susceptible, 1= resistant)
a2 = susceptible/resistant to the pathogen strain 2 (0 = susceptible, 1= resistant)
a3 = ...
a4 = ...




################
PhenotypeDiversity.csv
A matrix giving counts of how many times each Phenotype (in rows) (see PhenotypeCodes.csv) was observed in each of Layla's populations (in columns, population id being the actual patch id).
In the bottom row the population categories are given:
HSU = High connectivity, uninfected
LSU = Low connectivity, uninfected
HSI = High connectivity, infected
LSI = Low connectivity, infected.
